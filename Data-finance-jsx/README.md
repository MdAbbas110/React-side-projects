# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

//Approach that I took to create this website is step wise if you see first think react project with vite and the second thing that install tailwind with vite deleted the app.css

// navBar design was the div inside a h1 and then list of items
// then the second same div for mobile responsive view that was hidden Installed react-icon form npm intall and added the AiOutlineClose for opening and close icons
